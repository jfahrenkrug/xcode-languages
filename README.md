# xcode-languages

All the lproj languages that Xcode supports in a machine readable format.

Generated from Xcode Version **11.0**.

I was unable to find an authoritative list of the languages that Xcode allows
you to select from when adding lproj localizations to your iOS app. After trying
to extract those languages from Xcode's binaries proved unfruitful, I carefully
took screenshots of every section of the huge languages dropdown list,
parsed them iOS 13's Vision framework (OCR) and manually checked it for accuracy thereafter.

I hope this might be useful to some. Somehow.
